## Overview

Airbnb Data Analysis to suggest pricing structure for existing and future hosts.  Using Excel to analyze a raw data set, I strategically cleaned, transformed, explored, and interpreted the data, then communicated findings in an 8 minute PowerPoint presentation by enlisting Excel visualization techniques.

## Summary

First, I established clear goals and hypothesized that the above fields would provide enough insight to reach an actionable solution.

Next, in the exploratory analysis phase, I established some basic summary statistics to get a feel for the data set.  This includes a histogram for frequency of prices.

A quick pivot table led me to pursue the entire home/apt sector first.

Further analysis revealed an obvious correlation with bedroom count and higher prices.  
Next, I established prices for each bedroom price in the entire home/apt sector.

Following, a look at Neighborhood price categories suggest I investigate the suspect neighborhoods.

Finding that location, and not size, contributed to the higher listing price, I decided that a neighborhood premium was appropriate.  Further investigation under listing description showed that the area was indeed downtown Asheville.

Next, some basic and popular amenities begged to be analyzed.  Here, I'm showing the difference in listings with and without WiFi

After a similar comparison of other amenities, I've got a rudimentary scaffolding for a pricing structure:

## Conclusion 

This analysis gives us a feel for where Airbnb is in terms of their listing prices for Asheville.  The information in this analysis would be useful for existing hosts to read and decide whether they want to adjust their existing prices, as well as new hosts preparing to post their listings for the first time.  This basic pricing structure is by no means comprehensive and to build something more robust, we would need to gather more data such as stated in the final slide of the presentation.
